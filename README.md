The game will present you a flag of two countries, and you must select the one with the largest population.

Each round, you will be presented with a new set of countries to choose from. If you select the country with the larger population, you will earn points. If you select a country with a smaller population, you will lose points.

The game will keep track of your score, if the score reaches 0, YOU LOSE!!

## Game Components

The game includes the following components:

- A choice of two countries and their populations, which are used to present the options for each round.
- A scoring system that keeps track of the player's score.
- A kind of "Start Game" button(you have to click the flag), which begins the game when clicked.
